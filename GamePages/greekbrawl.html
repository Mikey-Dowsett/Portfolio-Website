            Greek Brawl was my attempt at a simple turn-based game. At the start of the game, the player and AI are given four randomly selected characters. 
            The player plays as the gods, while the AI plays as monsters. Each character has attack damage, an accuracy chance, and a special ability. 
            The special ability is charged up by attacking and getting hit. 
            Each character also falls into one of six classes, each one of which does critical damage to another class. 
            My main focus while working on this project was the systems, creating the AI for the enemy to give it a good chance of winning. 
            As well as the turn-based system that kept track of all the characters. 
            The art and sound effects did not match up well, and the UI was very clunky. 
            This project was much more of a technical piece than a visual and it shows.
