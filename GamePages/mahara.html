        <p id="description">
            Mahara was made in three days for the MashUp Game Jam 2 with the theme "Unconventional Means". 
            This was my first game jam so I decided to keep it simple by making a platformer. 
            I had the game fit the theme by switching the gravity instead of jumping. 
            I also created floors you can't touch, enemies that walk back and forth, and an enemy that shoots projectiles. 
            While the game mechanics had potential, I was still new to making games without following tutorials at the time, so the difficulty was very inconsistent. 
            The sounds aren't very good and don't fit with the art style. 
            The art is also inconsistent with itself, the player is far more detailed than the environment, and the background isn't even pixel art. 
            I learned a lot from the game though, especially about planning games and making them quickly.
